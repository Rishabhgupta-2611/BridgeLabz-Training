# BridgeLabz – Core Java Training Log

This repository contains my daily practice work and lab assignments for the **Capgemini – BridgeLabz Core Java Training Program** (4 months), which started on **16 December 2025** (Tuesday). The focus is on Core Java fundamentals, clean coding, and problem‑solving through small, well‑structured console programs.

## Week 1: Setup, Basics & Control Flow (16/12/2025 – 20/12/2025)

### Tuesday – 16 Dec 2025: Environment & Tools

- Installed and verified **JDK** for Core Java development.  
- Configured **Git**, **GitHub**, and **Git Bash** for version control.  
- Created the `BridgeLabz-Training` repository and organized the `core-java-practice` branch.  
- Practiced basic Git workflow: `git init`, `git status`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push` for daily submissions.

### Wednesday – 17 Dec 2025: Java Programming Elements – Level 1

- Revised Java basics: comments, data types (`int`, `double`, `char`, `String`), variables, and arithmetic operators.  
- Followed best practices for variable naming (camelCase), class naming, and indentation.  
- Implemented Level 1 problems: age calculation, unit conversions, profit/discount calculation, and basic numeric programs using well‑named variables (no magic numbers).

### Thursday – 18 Dec 2025: Programming Elements – Level 2

- Used the `Scanner` class to build user‑input‑driven programs (`nextInt`, `nextDouble`).  
- Implemented Level 2 programs: calculator (add/subtract/multiply/divide), area and distance calculations, handshake count using the \(n(n - 1)/2\) formula, and other numeric utilities.  
- Focused on avoiding hardcoding, correct operator precedence, and clear, single‑responsibility classes.

### Friday – 19 Dec 2025: Control Flow – Level 1

- Practiced decision making using `if/else` and loops (`while`, `for`).  
- Implemented control‑flow programs: divisibility checks, voting eligibility, positive/negative/zero classification, natural number validation, and Spring season check.  
- Wrote loop‑based programs: countdown (while/for), sum of digits, sum of `n` natural numbers (formula + loop), and factorial (while → for).

### Saturday – 20 Dec 2025: Control Flow – Level 2 (Intro)

- Applied loops and conditions to more logic‑oriented problems.  
- Implemented programs to:  
  - Print odd and even numbers from 1 to a user‑entered natural number.  
  - Calculate a 5% employee bonus when years of service > 5 (salary and years as input).  
  - Print a multiplication table of a given number from 6 to 9 in the format `number * i = result`.  
- Prepared for upcoming Level 2 topics: FizzBuzz, factor and greatest factor, and power calculation using both `for` and `while` loops.

This structure separates core lab work, scenario problems, and external problem‑solving, making the repository easy to review from a training and evaluation perspective.

## Tech Stack & Coding Standards

- **Language:** Java (Core Java, console applications).  
- **Version Control:** Git with GitHub remote, using frequent, descriptive commits.  
- **Tools:** JDK, Git Bash, IDE (Eclipse/IntelliJ).  
- **Practices:**  
  - All values stored in variables (fixed, input, results) – no hardcoded literals.  
  - Clear, purpose‑driven class names (e.g., `SumNaturalNumbers`, `EmployeeBonus`, `MultiplicationTable`).  
  - Consistent indentation and comments for key logical blocks (declarations, conditionals, loops).
